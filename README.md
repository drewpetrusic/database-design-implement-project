Database design and implementation project.

Exported the entire database into a dump labelled DB_Dump that should contain everything in the database including stored_procedures,functions,views, and triggers. 
Keep in mind the Trigger is listed under the table (In this case the player table). 
In addition, all of the files used to create the database and the data in the database are included. 
Lastly, javafiles were exported as individual files and the executable JAR that is used for the final presentation.
